#### Build of Materials:

- Raspberry Pi 4 4GB ($55)
- Pi Camera Module v2 - We may need multiple ($25)
- Ultrasonic Module - HC-SR04 ($10)
- 400 Point Breadboard ($10)
- Jumper cables, should come with the breadboard
- "Robot" Tires - DC 3-6V ($17)
- Adafruit Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver - ADA807 ($6)
- And Of Course, Battery Power Is Our Biggest, and Most Expensive Issue

### Hardware

#### Motors
Get our unit to where it needs to be.

#### Ultrasonic Sensors
The "smart" part of the unit, so it doesn't bump into random things.

#### Cameras
Know what we're looking at, and focus on the teacher/front of the room, while also seeing the rest of the room.

### Software

> All the code is crucial to make our hardware work. However, some aspects of this project are mainly software.

#### Physical Interface
Move our motors, move over to the charging cradle.

#### Cameras
Be able to get a grasp of the classroom from multiple angles.

#### Audio Detection
We need to identify the best area to hear the teacher loudest, and the rest of the classroom.
